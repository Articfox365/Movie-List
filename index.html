    <p>I liked it because of how suspenseful it was, it had me on the edge of my seat.</p>
    <h2>Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It</h2>
    <p>I loved the atomsphere the movie provides when watching.</p>
    <h2>The Mask</h2>
    <p>I love how funny it is, and I honestly love anything Jim Carry is in.</p>
